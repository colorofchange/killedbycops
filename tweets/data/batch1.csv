The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon.

Barlowe,,"6/8/2001: According to police Capt. Walter Almond, the events leading to Carters death began when Agee stopped a black 1997 Honda because of complaints that ""loud music"" coming from the vehicle was bothering some residents. A license check revealed the driver was wanted on a misdemeanor charge of property damage. When Agee returned to the vehicle, he asked the car's two passengers to step outside. When Carter emerged from the backseat, Almond said, four packets of marijuana fell from his clothing. Carter then bolted and led Agee on a circular foot chase. The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon. Instead, Almond says, Carter kept the gun trained on Agee. Goins and Goldie then fired numerous rounds, striking Carter from his leg to his left side. Police acknowledge Carter was shot at least 12 times http://www.richmond.com/city-life/article_cb0d80d8-e255-534b-8fdb-430f89064652.html",21,358

The police entered the premises and found Michael Sanders, who appeared disoriented, standing unclothed and behind his wife, Lavette Sanders. The officers decided to subdue Michael Sanders by firing tasers at his naked body, although Fresno Police Department rules and other instructions require that tasers not come in contact with human skin. The officers fired numerous taser darts into Michael Sanders’s body. The officers then handcuffed Sanders, placed him face down on a gurney, which suffocated him, and then placed him in an ambulance. Sanders ultimately stopped breathing. One of the officer attempted CRP, but Michael Sanders was pronounced dead at 4:30 a.m. http://www.ecdlaw.info/outlines/4-2-08%20Sanders%20(CA)%20Order%20Granting%20City%20Def's%20MSJ.pdf",262,450
