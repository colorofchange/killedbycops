Rigo with his hands raised in the air, was telling Deputy Mendoza that he did not have to do anything, when the deputy shot him once in the chest. In order to try and justify the shooting Deputy Mendoza is claiming that Rigo was trying to grab his gun. However, independent percipient witnesses who saw the shooting, describe Rigo as having his hands raised over his head when he was shot and that he was approximately 10 feet away from the deputy when the deputy shot and killed him. http://ktla.com/2013/05/13/family-of-man-killed-in-deputy-involved-cudahy-shooting-disputes-sheriffs-account-of-incident/",1002,
